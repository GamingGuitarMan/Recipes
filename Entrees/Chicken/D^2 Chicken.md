# D^2 Chicken

---

### Notes
- For best results, make sauce beforehand, and let chicken marinate overnight in not quite half of the sauce, but not necessary
- When meal prepping, I use double the recipe
- When mariating, I double the sauce (half for marinade, half for serving)
- Cook vegtable of your choice for the side, I usually cook asparagus in the oven while chicken and pasta is cooking
