## Instructions

#### For Turkey Sausage (do first)

1. In a large bowl, add turkey and all of the seasoning and brown sugar. Mix thoroughly to incorporate into the meat 

2. In large skillet over medium-high heat, add 1 TBS of oil and add in turkey. BROWN ON BOTH SIDES BEFORE BREAKING UP. cook until no pink color remains. (start burrito filling section of recipe while cooking)

3. Break up into small pieces and set aside until you are ready for it later

#### For Burrito Filling

1. While turkey is cooking, wash and prep all your vegtables

2. Cut peppers and onion into a small dice and roughly chop the spinach into smaller pieces. Measure out 2 cups of frozen shredded hash browns

3. IN a large skillet over medium high heat add 1 TBS of oil and add in the peppers and onions. Allow them to cook down and soften. Season lightly with salt early to help encourage some of the water to be released faster

4. Once the onions have begun to turn translucent, add in the hash browns and spincach. Stir to combine and wilt the spinach

5. Crack 8 eggs into a bowl, add 2 TBS of milk and beat until smooth

6. Cook eggs in same skillet or separate one at the same time as the vegtables cook. If using same skillet, create room in center to cook eggs

7. Add 1 TBS of oil and pour the eggs into the center to make scrambled eggs. Cook for a few minutes until they have finished

8. Once done remove from the heat and stir in the sausage. Mix and give it a taste test. Adjust falvor with salt and pepper as necessary

9. ALLOW MIXTURE TO COOL COMPLETELY BEFORE YOU CONSTRUCT BURRITOS, put in fridge for a few minutes if necessary

## Constructing Burritos

1. May yeild more or less than 17 burritos depending on how much filling per, and skill in burrito wrapping

2. Measure out 1 cup of shredded cheese

3. Lay out tortillas on work space. Place a couple large spoonfuls of filling on top of each. (around 70-80 grams in original recipe)

4. Add about 1 TBS of shredded cheese to top of filling and roll burrito up. 

5. Repeat until all are made!

6. If vaccum sealing, flash freeze first to preserve moisture, if using regular freezer bags, then flash freezing is not necessary.

## Reheating
1. Recommended wrapping inside of damp paper towel and microwaving for 60-75 seconds. I found I didn't have to wrap the burrito and it took closer to 3 minutes to ensure the center was hot.
