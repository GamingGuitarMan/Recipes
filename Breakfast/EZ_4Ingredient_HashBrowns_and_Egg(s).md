1. Peel and shred the potatoes, then squeeze the water out of them (within a towel can work). Then salt and pepper them
2. Put a fair amount of oil in the bottom of a medium-large round pan, and fully cover bottom with a layer of potatoes (don't use all of them, for 2 servings with 3 potatoes use a quarter of the shredded potatoes)
3. Sprinkle parsely and parmesean cheese on top
4. Put more potatoes on top (another quarter of the shredded potatoes if using 3 potatoes for 2 servings) and then push all sides in a little bit
5. When ready (crispy) flip over
6. Take off and fry the egg in the pan. Over-easy will give you the yummy egg juices
7. Put egg on top of hash browns and put some more parmesean and parsley to top it off
